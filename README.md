# 📘 Kasa Front-End Development Project
Welcome to the Kasa Front-End Development Repository! This project marks the next evolution of Kasa, one of the leaders in the peer-to-peer apartment rental market in France. The goal? A sleek, modern, and highly performant web platform.

## 🌟 Overview
Kasa has been connecting people to apartments for over 10 years, with over 500 new listings every day. To stay ahead, we’re rebuilding the platform from scratch using cutting-edge JavaScript technologies.

## 🛠️ Key Objectives
Build with React:

- Modular, reusable components for scalability.
- Dynamic routing using React Router.
- Use JSON mock data to simulate back-end integration.
- Styling with Sass:

Write clean, modular Sass styles.
Implement CSS animations for dropdowns and galleries.

## Functional Features:

Implement responsive Gallery and Collapse components as per Figma prototypes.
Ensure accessibility and seamless user experience.

## 🖼️ Gallery Component
Circular navigation:
From the first image to the last, and vice versa.
Smart button logic:
Hide navigation controls when there’s only one image.
Fixed height:
Images maintain consistent height, centered within the frame.

## 📂 Collapse Component
Default state:
Collapsed on load.
Toggle logic:
Open/close on click, maintaining independent states.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Guidelines
Core Stack
React:

Functional components with props and state.
Dynamic rendering of lists using .map().
